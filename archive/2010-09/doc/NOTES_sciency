I wonder if I should choose my cut-off
threshold at an E-value or at a score.

As Kevin mentioned, E-values are
database-size dependant. Scores are not.

For instance, take gene Os3g13690.
Searching for it in in the small JGI database
gave a somewhat good E-value, 0.002.
In the large concatenated database was 0.35 E-value.
But it had a pretty bad score of 18.8 (in any db)
