Build Workflow:

Steps
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Generate FASTA files by family from the database -> 
2. Download new sequence files (FASTA) -> OK
3. MA of sample/old sequences by family (Clean-up step) (except NCI)
4. HMM create model: HMM by family using MAs from step 3.
5. HMM search (apply model): HMM search by family output: FASTA files by family from 2.
6. Load new builds into database
   6.1 load all sequence to stage
   6.2 load family files
   6.3 map new family data to gfam model 
   6.4 load new family into gfam
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. load gff for all families in one step
8. find dna for proteins (gff/chromosomes)
