Update Method
-------------

Updating the data in CWN_ is rather simple:
    1.  All of the source databases (UniPRot_, TIGR_, GenBank_) are
        updated.
    2.  The families are updated. Certain families are updated in
        different manners, however in general its simply:
        1.  run hmmsearch over the source databases.
        2.  parse the output
        3.  check for errors
        4.  output as xml.
    3.  The cellwall_test database is dropped and reloaded, to remove any
        possible stale data.
    4.  './cellwall insert cellwall.xml' is run to insert the data into MySQL.
    5.  The additional annotations are loaded:
        1. the old users and comments, ./cellwall annotate data/annotations/Users.txt
        2. display ids: ./cellwall annotate data/annotation/DisplayIDs.txt
        3. tair's publication list (ignoring the many extra ids):
            ./cellwall tair data/Locus_published.DATE > tmp
            ./cellwall annotate tmp
            rm tmp
        4. Mutants: ./cellwall mutants data/gene_aliass.DATE (ignore missing)
        5. PFAM data:
            ./cellwall get proteins > proteins.fa
            hmm-pfam -o proteins.hmmerout /data/PFAM/Pfam_ls proteins.fa
            tools/add_domains.pl proteins.hmmerout
